                  <h2>What is a coronavirus?</h2>
                </li>
                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in
                  animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections
                  ranging
                  from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and
                  Severe
                  Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus
                  disease
                  COVID-19.</p>
                <li>
                  <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
                </li>
                <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus
                  and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>
                <li>
                  <h2>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h2>
                </li>
                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have
                  aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
                  mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don't develop any symptoms and don't feel
                  unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1
                  out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older
                  people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                  diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty
                  breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
                <li>
                  <h2>How does COVID-19 spread?</h2>
                </li>
                <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to
                  person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                  coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then
                  catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
                  can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or
                  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person
                  who is sick.</p>
                <li>
                  <h2>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h2>
                </li>
                <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact
                  with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.</p>
                <li>
                  <h2>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h2>
                </li>
                <p>he main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing.
                  The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people
                  with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the
                  disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild
                  cough and does not feel ill.</p>
